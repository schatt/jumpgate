Contributing
============

Jumpgate and SoftLayer drivers were created and are maintained by SoftLayer, an IBM Company. We welcome anyone to submit pull requests for fixes or new features, but ask that you follow a few simple steps.

1. All pull requests should be submitted for a reported issue or must include a detailed explanation of what's being changed. For new features, we'd prefer there already be an existing, approved issue in Github, but we're flexible.

2. All changes should follow PEP8_ guidelines.

3. When contributing to a driver, your changes should not break any currently passing Tempest tests. If you introduce new functionality, please update the Tempest test whitelist to test the new functionality.

4. Sign our contributor agreement (CLA)

  * You can find the individual `CLA here <./docs/cla-individual.md>`_.
  * If you're contributing on behalf of your employer we'll need a signed copy of our corporate contributor agreement (CCLA) as well.  You can find the `CCLA <./docs/cla-corporate.md>`_.
